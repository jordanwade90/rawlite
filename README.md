# rawlite: mapreduce into SQLite databases

rawlite exposes a multithreaded API to create SQLite databases.
See the [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jordanwade90/rawlite)
for documentation.

Currently the library is alpha quality;
I believe it works but it needs better documentation and tests.
